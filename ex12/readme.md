#Exercise 12
##Prompting People for Numbers

```ruby
print "Give me a number: "
number = gets.chomp.to_i

bigger = number * 100
puts "A bigger number is #{bigger}."

print "Give me another number: "
another = gets.chomp
number = another.to_i

smaller = number / 100
puts "A smaller number is #{smaller}."
```

#Study Drills
0. Try out the .to_f operation. What does .to_f do?
0. To play with .to_f more, make a small script that asks for some money and gives back 10% of it. If I give your script 103.4 (dollars), your script gives me back 10.34 in change.
