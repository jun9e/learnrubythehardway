#Exercise 3
##Numbers and Math

```ruby
puts "I will now count my chickens:"

puts "Hens #{25 + 30 / 6}"
puts "Roosters #{100 - 25 * 3 % 4}"

puts "Now I will count the eggs:"

puts 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

puts "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

puts 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

puts "What is 3 + 2? #{3 + 2}"
puts "What is 5 - 7? #{5 - 7}"

puts "Oh, that's why it's false."

puts "How about some more."

puts "Is it greater? #{5 > -2}"
puts "Is it greater or equal? #{5 >= -2}"
puts "Is it less or equal? #{5 <= -2}"
```

##Study Drills

0. Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
0. Remember in Exercise 0 when you started Ruby? Start Ruby this way again and using the math operators, use Ruby as a calculator.
0. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.
0. Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. You need to use a "floating point" number, which is a number with a decimal point, as in 10.5, or 0.89, or even 3.0.
0. Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.
